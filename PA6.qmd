## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
<<<<<<< HEAD
1 + 2
=======
1 + 1
"hi"
>>>>>>> 3eb8204e5d44f1a1d31e055dd8630fc2dc0c4794
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
13 * 12
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
